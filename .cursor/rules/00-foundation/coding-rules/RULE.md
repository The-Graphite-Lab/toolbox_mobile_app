-- never use emojis in anything you generate whether that be code, guides, or responses in chat
-- if you need an icon in react you can use font-awesome
-- if you make a change to the code base, always evaluate if we need to make adjustments, deletions, or updates to existing code based on the new changes
-- before you code, always think through the ask and how to best achieve it, develop a plan, execute the plan, and evaluate how well you achieved the plan
