-- Always store instruction guides in the guides directory
-- Never add guides to the root project directory
-- if you see a .md guide in the main project directory move it to the guides directory
-- always use subfolders in the guides directory to organize the guides 
-- never duplicate an existing guide, just update them if needed
-- if asked to organize guides then look in the project root for .md files that need organized, plan how to sort them into the guides folder, and then move them
