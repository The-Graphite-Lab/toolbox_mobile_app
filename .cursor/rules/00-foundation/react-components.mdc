- no 1 react component should be to overloaded with content/capabilities. Break things down into smaller, reusable components where possible
- if we need content many places, like the current user, then make it accessible using hooks so there is a standard access point everywhere in the app
- if we can use a component in other parts of the app, it should be stored in a relevant components directory
- if a component is only used on a specific page/route then it can be in a subcomponents folder
- we should use mui components where possible unless the use case truly needs a custom component
